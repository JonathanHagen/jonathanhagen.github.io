My name is Jonathan Hagen. I created this website to provide a sort of quick-start guide to getting your favorite sounds. I'll post:

- Presets
- Guides
- Some random helpful notes

### How I Got Here

Having messed with a few pedals (a Boss Overdrive and Hall of Fame 2) I was seeking a bit more versitility and decided to enter the multi-fx pedalboard world. I bought the Valenton GP200 in December 2022, and have been fiddling with it ever since. I've been disappointed with the availability of presets for this unit, and have been growing my own library trying to emulate the sounds of my favorite bands. It's a real drawback for me and other beginners when you have to purchase presets or IRs just to get the sound you want- so that's the inspiration for this site: a place for me to host patches for <b>free<b>.
